 A simple shopping list I made with React. 
 
 The app content is currently only in Finnish since I'm planning to use with my partner â€“ and not using our mutual everyday grocery-jargon seems counter-intuitive to the app's purpose. 
 
 Next I'm planning to a) try and make the app multi-user and b) improve the UI.
